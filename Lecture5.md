**Job control**
1. From what we have seen, we can use some `ps aux | grep` commands to get our jobsâ€™ pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a `sleep 10000` job in a terminal, background it with `Ctrl-Z` and continue its execution with `bg`. Now use `pgrep` to find its pid and `pkill` to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the `-af` flags).

    **Solution**
    ```bash
    pgrep -a sleep
    ```
